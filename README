## 🧭 How It Works

1. **Frontend**  
   - A one-page form (`index.html`) asks for:
     - Monthly income
     - Spending habits (fuel, travel, groceries)
     - Preferred benefits (cashback, lounge access)
     - Credit score  
   - On form submission, it sends data to the backend via `/recommend`.

2. **Backend**  
   - Built with **Flask** (`main.py`) and serves routes:
     - `GET /` → serves the form
     - `POST /recommend` → processes user data
   - Loads `cards.json` containing 20 Indian credit cards with details (name, issuer, fees, perks).
   - Uses **LangChain** and **ChatGroq** (`llama3-70b-8192`) to:
     - Build a prompt combining user preferences and available cards
     - Generate the top 3 personalized recommendations

3. **Output**  
   - The LLM returns recommendations with:
     - Card name
     - Reason for fit
     - Estimated yearly rewards  
   - Shown to the user on the same page.
